ARC is organised into professions - Research Infrastructure Developer, Data Scientist, Data Steward, and Research Software Engineer.

We operate a number of research projects, services, and products, and our staff are assigned to these activities through a regular mapping process, once a term.

Here are some examples of how people might describe their roles:

"My name’s Aiden. I’m a Senior Data Steward. My line manager is Beth, a principal data steward. I’m currently working on the Discoverability module of the Research Data Archive component of the Research Data Product. As a Senior data steward, I’m also responsible for Discoverability Architecture for UCL research data."

"My name’s Clare. I’m a Principal Research Infrastructure Developer. My line manager is Owain, the Head of Profession for Research Infrastructure Developers. I’m currently working on deploying Prof Davina’s Imaging Pipeline to our on-prem-cloud, as part of the Team-based-research product. As a Principal, I’m also responsible for our cloud strategy and I manage some other research infrastructure developers."

"I’m a <grade-name> <profession>. My line manager is a <grade-name +1> <profession>. I’m currently working on <activity> in <product>. {if grade > 7} I’m also responsible for <additional area of departmental responsibility>{end-if} "

All staff both work to build and maintain our platforms and tools, and act as staff scientists, being allocated to our collaborative research projects or lead research projects themselves. All staff will also (to an amount depending on grade) contribute to service responsiveness and ticketing for ARC services.

Some staff may prefer to spend more (or all) their time on one or other of these branches, and line managers will be accommodating of these preferences, and job descriptions will reflect this hybrid research/service nature for all ARC roles.

An additional ARC Operations and Strategy Group, led by a Head of Strategy Operations, will comprise our non-technical staff. These staff will be expected to develop a knowledge of the policy and operational framework of digital research appropriate to their grade, and some will also be research active, for example, through leading activities like the ‘Hidden REF’ or through qualitative research on research management policy.

If, through promotion processes, professions end up with more than one member at Principal grade, they have the option to rotate the office of Head-of-profession, “taking turns” in the manner of a research department.
At G8 and above, staff are expected to have one or more responsibilities alongside core technical contributions. This might include product and platform ownership,  head of group or director roles, line management, leader of a research programme, or head-of-profession roles for one of the research technology professional families.
We will, whenever possible, avoid creating short-term project specific postdoctoral appointments, instead creating roles in the staff scientist pools funded by research income according to our risk model.
