1. And/or: Practical knowledge of research software and workflows and supporting researchers in their use. - Essential (1 of 3) 
1. And/or: Practical knowledge and experience of supporting researchers in their managment of research data, which should include at least one of the following: large scale storage (eg GPFS, Lustre, S3 etc), archive, backup or data publication technologies - Essential (1 of 3)
1. Demonstrable understanding of at least one area of specialism within digital research infrastructures, for example parallel file systems, high-performance interconnects or schedulers, hybrid public/private cloud infrastructure or other associated technologies, or the configuration and use of software associated with a particular research field. In order to maintain balance within the team, our recruitment may from time to time require one such specialism in particular, and this will be noted within the advert. - Essential
