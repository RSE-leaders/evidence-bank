The following technical specialist requirements apply at Grade 7 and above only. At Grade 6 (“Junior”) candidates are expected to show only the aptitude to develop one of these specialisms.
Research Software Developer
Criteria
Essential or Desirable
Experience with the authorship, development, and maintenance of software for research & development in any field. This might include (but is not limited to) software supporting data processing and statistical analysis, image analysis tools, front- and back-end web development, mobile apps, high-performance simulation software, or mathematical software. In order to maintain balance within the team, our recruitments may from time to time require one such specialism in particular, and this will be noted within the advert.
Essential
Knowledge of and commitment to software engineering best practise including issue tracking, testing, documentation, version control and continuous integration.
Essential
Experience with at least one programming language used for research (such as C, C++, Fortran, Javascript, Julia, Python, or R) at a level and breadth commensurate with seniority.
Essential

Research Infrastructure Developer
Criteria
Essential or Desirable
Either:
Practical knowledge of operating systems and their maintenance, directory & authentication technologies, and TCP/IP networking, including familiarity with common Internet protocols (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, LDAP, SFTP/SSH, etc.) and associated client software
And/or:
Practical knowledge of research software and workflows and supporting researchers in their use.
And/or:
Practical knowledge and experience of supporting researchers in their managment of research data, which should include at least one of the following: large scale storage (eg GPFS, Lustre, S3 etc), archive, backup or data publication technologies.   
Essential
Demonstrable understanding of at least one area of specialism within digital research infrastructures, for example parallel file systems, high-performance interconnects or schedulers, hybrid public/private cloud infrastructure or other associated technologies, or the configuration and use of software associated with a particular research field. In order to maintain balance within the team, our recruitment may from time to time require one such specialism in particular, and this will be noted within the advert.
Essential
Experience with the Linux command line shell
Essential
Linux/Unix system implementation and administration and related technologies
