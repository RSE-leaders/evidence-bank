ARC roles can be both research roles, contributing to the scholarly life of the university, carrying out research and teaching, and professional service roles, delivering shared capabilities and following professional best practice.
You will be part of ARCâ€™s community of staff scientists and research technology professionals, both delivering the services and systems which make data and compute-intensive research possible, and discovering and innovating new tools, practices and systems in this field. Our positioning as a hybrid of a research institute and service centre means these activities will be synergistic.
You will develop and maintain technical or domain specialisms. This could mean building on your background to remain close to the research life of one or more of the academic disciplines we collaborate with (e.g. via honorary membership of an academic department), or engaging closely with the technology professional communities related to a platform, tool or language that you focus on.
You will work with your management to define a portfolio of responsibilities, a mixture of service delivery, research, innovation, and teaching activities according to your own preferences and skills, and appropriate to your level of seniority.
We describe our research professionals within four groupings, knowing that these are fluid categories, and welcome those who cross the boundaries between these. Within the framework described in this document, you may agree with your line manager to modify your job title to reflect your career aspirations e.g. Senior Research Software Engineer (HPC), Principal Data Steward (Medical Imaging) or Junior Bioinformatician. In each case below, we list our primary title, followed by a number of exemplar alternative job titles people may choose if they prefer.
Research Software Developers (also known as Research Software Engineer, Software Engineer, Developer, HPC Programmer, Scientific Programmer, ...):
Collaborate with research colleagues from across UCL to construct, improve, and maintain codes used for modelling, analysis, synthesis, simulation and more.
Rapidly assimilate research context through publications and conversation with research groups, understand the computational algorithms, requirements and interfaces needed within the research effort, and construct high-quality software for research colleagues which will result in a sustained impact on their research programme. 
Provide consulting on software practices, techniques, design, and architecture to research groups, helping to build robust and maintainable research software.
Research Infrastructure Developers (also known as Research Infrastructure Engineers, Research Data Engineers, ML-Ops, Res-Ops, Dev-Ops Engineer, Data Engineer):
Design, develop, enhance and automate new computing and data infrastructures and related tools and services for use by researchers, including anything from high-performance and high-throughput parallel infrastructures to services for data management.
Support the operation of research platforms and tools, assisting researchers with advice and help as needed, and recommending and implementing improvements based on user feedback.
Work closely as part of a team with researchers to develop bespoke, scalable, sustainable infrastructure and applications to support their projects.
Act as drivers of best practices in research infrastructure technologies and/or applications, developing and demonstrating in-depth knowledge of the area, staying up to date with and contributing to the body of knowledge through research and development.
Lead on applying DevOps techniques to research projects and infrastructure.
Research Data Stewards (also known as Data Librarian, Data Curator, Data Wrangler, Bioinformatician, Data Consultant, Data Manager):
Provide researchers with technically-focused research data management advice and consultancy.
Coordinate data management for research projects or departments, including planning, designing workflows and processes, and data documentation.
Developing software and scripts for data and metadata transformations and migrations.
Encouraging the adoption of best practice data management techniques, metadata standards, FAIR data principles, and Open Science values.
Contribute to research data service design and improvement based on researcher or institutional requirements.
Maintain a close relationship with UCL library, as well as within ARC.
Research Data Scientists (also known as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Specialist, Computational Statistician, Data Wrangler, Bioinformatician, Data Analyst):
Conduct collaborative research to extract knowledge and insight from datasets using a variety of mathematical, statistical and computational approaches.
Develop software and scripts to implement these analyses in robust and reproducible ways.
Work with research infrastructure developers to deploy these to production.
Research Managers:
Enable the delivery and growth of research investments through excellent policies, processes and expert domain specialisms.
Build and maintain relationships with research and technical communities, creating collaborations and generating opportunities.
Develop and realise opportunities for research investment, authoring and costing proposals and business cases to funders both internal and external.
Coordinate delivery of research projects and technology change programmes, managing deliverables and investments.
Help to drive impact from digital research, supporting the dissemination and use of outputs such as software libraries and datasets.
