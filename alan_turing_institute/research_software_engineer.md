# Research Data Scientist/Research Software Engineer

Salary: £35-45,000 or £45-60,000 Senior (negotiable dependent on skills & experience)

Type of contract: Permanent, Full-time & Part-time

Closing date: Rolling Recruitment. Applications reviewed monthly.

An outstanding opportunity for interdisciplinary researchers to bring cutting-edge research ideas face to face with real-world problems.

## The Alan Turing Institute

Launched in November 2015, the Alan Turing Institute is the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to make great leaps in research to change the world for the better.

The Institute is headquartered at The British Library, and brings together researchers from a range of disciplines – mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering and social sciences, – from thirteen leading universities and industry partners.

## The Role

The permanent research staff of the institute’s Research Engineering Group work to realise cutting edge research as professionally usable software tools and to apply these to address real-world data science and modelling challenges.

The group’s staff are research software engineers and data scientists. We note the considerable overlap between these emerging roles and embrace the breadth of interdisciplinary skills and diversity of approaches entailed in these fields. Staff can choose either job title, and change their choice as their career progresses.

In contrast to traditional research careers, we are committed expert collaborators, joining research teams to further the Institute's challenges. We collaborate with scholars across the institute’s research community to enhance the applicability of research for particular problems and with clients to turn their challenges into research questions. We create software and scripts that implement research and apply it to client data in a readable, reliable and reproducible fashion.

We present conclusions of research and analysis to the research community and clients through presentations, research papers, and interactive data visualisations, and support the dissemination of research outputs through the publication and maintenance of open source research software packages.

We work with state of the art advanced high performance computing and cloud platforms to realise collaborators' data science and artificial intelligence research at scale.

## Main Responsibilities

* Apply state-of-the-art and novel data science and artificial intelligence techniques emerging from the Institute and elsewhere to problems faced by the Turing’s clients
* Collaborate with research colleagues to develop and maintain software embodying research outputs
* Present, disseminate and explain our work
* Contribute to the life of the Institute and support its community
* In addition, for senior staff only:
  * Provide technical project management and leadership for 1-3 research projects, ensuring successful outcomes, liaising with clients and colleagues to understand and prioritise project goals, and balancing client value with research outputs.
  * Line manage 1-3 other staff within the group, supporting their career development aspirations.
  * Take ownership of a particular domain challenge area or methodology for the group.
  * Develop new projects in conjunction with colleagues, authoring research proposals and agreeing involvement for the group in activities across the institute.
 

## Person Specification

Essential

* A PhD degree or equivalent professional experience in a field with significant use of both computer programming and advanced statistical or numerical methods.
* Experience managing, structuring, and analysing research data.
* Experience managing and organising the parameters and results of computational experiments.
* Fluency in one or more modern programming languages used in research in data science and artificial intelligence. (We particularly work in R, Python, and modern C++, but demonstrable use of other programming languages for research, together with a facility for learning new languages, is most welcome.)
* An understanding of the importance of good practices for producing reliable software and reproducible analyses (e.g. version control, issue tracking, automated testing, package management, literate analysis tools such as Jupyter and Rmarkdown)
* Demonstrated enthusiasm and ability to rapidly assimilate new computational and mathematical ideas and techniques on the job, at a more than superficial level, and apply them successfully.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including experience in the visual representation of quantitative data, the authoring of research papers or technical reports, and giving presentations or classes on technical subjects.
* Ability to lead one’s own work independently, including planning and execution, and to collaborate productively as part of a team.
* In addition, for senior staff only:
* Experience mentoring and evaluating the work of others (formal line management experience is not essential, but such applicants should be able to show significant evidence of informal mentorship.)
* Experience leading a project to a successful conclusion
* Demonstrable experience managing conflict and resolving stakeholder tensions
* Experience authoring research proposals or business cases

Desirable

Successful candidates will be able to demonstrate existing knowledge of more than one of the   following:

* Machine learning, including experience with one or more established software libraries.
* Computational statistics, particularly Bayesian modelling.
* Visualisation for understanding large, complex, or high-dimensional data
* Knowledge management and ontology engineering, semantic web.
* Mathematical and computational modelling of complex systems.
* Logic, planning, verification, and automated reasoning.
* Programming language and API design. Domain specific languages.
* Exposure to mixed or qualitative research methods
* User interface design and development with web technologies, especially for data visualisation and knowledge representation.
* Advanced numerical simulation (e.g. FEM, CFD…)
* Experience with public cloud platforms
* Experience working with confidential and sensitive data for research.
* Developing for high-performance computing hardware (CUDA, MPI, OpenMP)
* Experience contributing to open source research software projects
* Working with databases and APIs for the acquisition of parameter information for models
* Experience working with legacy code, especially in traditional scientific programming languages (eg, Fortran, MATLAB, C)
* Experience leading teaching and training in computational or mathematical methods for research.
* Automated testing, software quality assurance and continuous integration.
