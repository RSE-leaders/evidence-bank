# RSE Group Evidence Bank

## What is this?

This repository contains useful information and resources for people or organisations wishing to
set up their own Research Software Engineering (RSE) group.

## How is it organised?

Each exisiting RSE group that has contributed material to the bank has created their own directory
with the information and resources. The information and resources will differ from group to 
group as their are many different ways to setup and run such a group.

Each resource contributed to the evidence bank should be tagged according to its *Goal*, its
*Type* and its *Audience*. The tags are described in more detail below.

### Resource tagging

Each piece of information or resource is tagged by according to:

* *Goal*: The goal(s) that this contribution is relevent to. Goal tags are:
  - **Setup**
  - **Impact**
  - **Status**
  - **Career**
* *Type*: The type of contribution. Contribution tags are:
  - **Case study**
  - **Testimonial**
  - **Statistics**
  - **Tactics**
  - **Business case**
* *Audience*: The audience(s) the contributions were written for. Audience tags are:
  - **HR**
  - **Management**
  - **Funders**

## Can I contribute?

Yes! This resource will be enhanced by more groups contributing information and resources. The
type of information that is useful includes:

* Information on the size and scale of the RSE group
* How the RSE group is postioned within the larger organisation
* Evidence that was used to help get approval for the group from the wider organisation
* How the RSE group is structured and managed
* How promotion and progression is managed within the group (and how this is facilitated by the wider organisation)
* What performance metrics the RSE group uses to demonstrate success
* Job descriptions

Not all groups will be able to provide all this information and they are not expected to to be
able to contribute - any useful resources and information are welcome and it is up to the 
individual group how they structure the information within their subdirectory.

You can contribute by forking the repository, adding your material and then issuing a pull 
request against this repository. Alternatively, you can send your material to
[info@rse.ac.uk](mailto:info@rse.ac.uk) and it can be added directly.

## RSE Groups

This section will list the RSE groups that have provided information into the evidence bank.

### [EPCC](EPCC/)

EPCC is a large RSE group (~100 staff) at the University of Edinburgh. It is not part of central computing services, rather it is a institute with the same status as an academic school within the University.

## Where did this come from?

The idea for this repository came from the International RSE Leaders Workshop hosted at the
Alan Turning Institute in London in January 2018. You can find the notes from the intial 
discussion at:
