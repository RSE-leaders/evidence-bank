# RSE Group Evidence Bank

## What is this?

This repository contains useful information and resources for people or organisations wishing to
set up their own Research Software Engineering (RSE) group.

## How is it organised?

Each exisiting RSE group that has contributed material to the bank has created their own directory
with the information and resources. The information and resources will differ from group to 
group as their are many different ways to setup and run such a group.

The table below lists the groups that have contributed information along with a brief overview
of their setup. Click on the group name to go directly to their information and resources.

## Can I contribute?

Yes! This resource will be enhanced by more groups contributing information and resources. The
type of information that is useful includes:

* Information on the size and scale of the RSE group
* How the RSE group is postioned within the larger organisation
* Evidence that was used to help get approval for the group from the wider organisation
* How the RSE group is structured and managed
* How promotion and progression is managed within the group (and how this is facilitated by the wider organisation)
* What performance metrics the RSE group uses to demonstrate success
* Job descriptions

Not all groups will be able to provide all this information and they are not expected to to be
able to contribute - any useful resources and information are welcome and it is up to the 
individual group how they structure the information within their subdirectory.

To get an idea of the type of information that would be useful please explore the information
that has already been provided by groups.

## Where did this come from?

The idea for this repository came from the International RSE Leaders Workshop hosted at the
Alan Turning Institute in London in January 2018. You can find the notes from the intial 
discussion at:
