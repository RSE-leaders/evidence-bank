# Evidence Bank 

Topic: Evidence pack for the value of why access to RSEs / RSE teams is a good idea.
Session 1 

## Notes from discussion

International evidence bank
* Start simple with a Google drive or repository
* Output: statement of purpose and scope
* Output: structure/submission protocol/rules

We’ll create a Github repository to hold the evidence because of the history, issue tracking, etc

We’ll start with a private repository and then discuss
* https://github.com/UKRSE/evidence-bank
* https://github.com/orgs/UKRSE/teams/evidence-bank

Purpose: A place to share metrics that leaders could use, and also a place to share experiences of how arguments were made to 

Note: we should start to collect management strategies in a similar fashion.

What’s collected depends on what people are trying to do. If you’re a national funder, then you’ll have a different take on what metrics are useful compared to a someone who’s making the case for setting up a 

### Metrics

Split into quantitative and qualitative
* Output: statement of purpose and scope
* Output: what’s included, how can it be collected
* Output: what’s been collected, what was useful and what was not
* Output: what’s missing

### Arguments and tactics
Are RSEs a partner of researchers? How do we gain recognition and show the value of work

### How to store the data
* Output: tag structure
  + Goal tags
    - Set up group
    - Impact
    - Status (nature of role)
    - Career progression
  + Type tags
    - Case study
    - Testimonial
    - Stats
    - Tactics
    - Business case
  + Audience
    - HR
    - Management
    - Funders

* Folder structure:
    - One folder per group

What we can collect
* Case studies - qualitative
* Testimonials - qualitative
* Number of papers - quantitative
* International collaborations created - 
* Downloads of software (I assume that these need collected before and after RSE effort has been invested into a project)
* Estimating the financial saving - possibly a “finger in the air” - but there’s a possibility of collecting the data over a range of projects and producing an “average saving per RSE hour invested”
* Estimating the time saving - similar to money argument (Sandra’s suggestion of Nectar project)
* Measures of things that couldn’t have happened without RSE input


## Purpose and scope

Helping other people set up new teams, demonstrating impact of an established team (for general management and also to prevent cuts, ditto for funders), raising visibility of the RSE group and role - and the importance of having RSE skills in an organisation (for the purpose of persuading groups like HR and also to persuade people to apply for roles), career progression exists to persuade established RSEs that they should stay within the role by describing the possibility of achieving promotions (plus making the case for employing the correct level of RSE for the skills required by a specific project). 

Career progression: need to include this in a business case to show that it has been thought about

Action: get the people who lead RSE groups (and similar) to add some metrics into this repository to see how it starts.

## Output(s) to be drafted


1. Nominate/force leadership onto Andy
2. A timeline for how this project will progress:
   1. 31 january 18: Ask for people to enter metrics into the repo (to be joined by Andy, Sandra and Simon)
   2. 31 March 18: First examples of case studies ready for review
   3. 30 April 18: Scott, Mark, Jan (and others?) review case studies and provide feedback
   4. 30 June 18: Open repo to all RSE leaders
   5. Repeatedly request metrics from RSE leaders in intervening period
   6. September 18: Announce to the world at RSE Conference
3. Set up a repository with a tagging as above
4. Sign up everyone to the metrics repository
5. Choose a group of RSE leaders to commit some metrics
6. Choose a group to review the usefulness of the metrics after they have been committed and provide feedback
7. Set up a working group
