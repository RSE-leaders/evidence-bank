# Research Software Engineer Job Descriptions
The UK invested £5.8 billion into research in the 2015-16 financial year [1]. According to a
study by the Software Sustainability Institute, at least 69% of this research – reflecting an
investment of around £4 billion – is reliant on software [2]. Without access to software
engineering expertise, research software is significantly less likely to meet the requirements
of reliability and reproducibility that we expect from research. The mission that cuts across
all the Research Software Engineer job descriptions submitted is to ensure software
produced for Digital Institute research projects meets the standards required to output
world class reproducible research.  

Over the last 10 years the Digital Institute has employed a small number of RSEs working
across a number of projects, contributing to research worth over £100m. With the recent
announcement of Newcastle’s first round of Turing Institute fellows, the RSE team needs to
rapidly expand to meet demand for its services. We would like to submit four job
descriptions that cover different RSE roles within a team, allowing us to have pre-graded
off-the-shelf job descriptions that can be used for recruitment. Not all of these roles will be
filled immediately, we see these as a way of structuring the future growth of the team.  

### Research Software Developer
A junior or internship position designed for people with little or no work experience. The
idea being they would transition to the bottom of the scale for a standard RSE after one
year.
### Research Software Engineer
The standard position within a team. RSEs are responsible for working across multiple
simultaneous projects and managing their own workloads.
### Senior Research Software Engineer (Skilled)
An experienced position designed for people who have significant levels of knowledge in a
particular specialism. This role is for people who are not natural managers but bring high
levels of software engineering skill to the team.
### Senior Research Software Engineer (Management)
An experienced position designed for management of RSEs. This role combines experience
of software engineering, research project management and line management.
