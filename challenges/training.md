# Training

There are two areas of training relevent to RSE teams:

- Training RSEs within the team
- Training non RSEs in software skills

## Training RSEs

Training is a challenge for RSE teams. RSEs often have a diverse set of skills and
backgrounds and need to be able to adapt to new projects in different domains and
with different technology stacks.

- Training RSEs themselves is required to ensure that they have the skills to
  work on a variety of projects.

## Training non RSEs

- Some RSE teams include training software skills in general as part of their remit.
- In some institutions this role is taken on by volunteer groups

- Training can be provided as structured courses or as drop in clinics.
