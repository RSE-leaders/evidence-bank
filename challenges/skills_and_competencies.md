# Skills and Competencies

- The most important skill is being able to learn and adapt.
- More senior RSEs develop a greater breadth of skills and knowledge rather
  than becoming technical experts in a particular area.
- Soft skills such as project management and communication are also particularly
  important for RSEs.

## Overfitting

- There is a risk of overfitting an RSE to a particular project or domain. How
  can we ensure that RSEs are able to work on a variety of projects and domains?
- It can be expensive and difficult to bring in an entirely embedded RSE into the
  central team.

## Talent Pipeline

It is important that we identify the talent pipeline in our community and through
outreach to ensure that we have a pool of candidates with the right skills at all
career stages.

We need to ensure that we have technical experts in the community that can disseminate
best practice and provide training.

### Entry Point Minimum Skills

- RSE teams are often small and don't always have the resources for training
  new staff. This means that new staff need to have a minimum set of skills
  when they join the team.
- We need to make sure that we identify the recruitment pipeline that ensures we
  have a pool of candidates with the right skills. This could include supporting
  training courses or apprenticeships.
- Some smaller teams have difficulty in finding the right candidates with the
  right skills.
- Some additional outreach is needed to make sure that we are attracting candidates
  that understand what is involved in the role.

## Leadership Skills

- More training is needed for RSEs to develop leadership skills.

## Team turnover

- High turnover can be a problem for RSE teams. How can we ensure that we retain
  staff?

## Skill retention

- Some skills are difficult to retain particularly in HPC support where the need can
  vary over time.
