# Project Aquisition

Project acquisition is the process of identifying, securing, and onboarding new
projects.

There are various methods for aquiring new projects used by RSE teams:

- Being approached by researchers
- Applying directly for funding
- Outreach events to researchers and research groups
- Releasing reports that market skills available
- Long term relationships with researchers and research
- Via free at the point of use services (HPC, data storage, etc)

## Timeframes

The timeframes for project acquisition can vary depending on the method used.
RSE teams are often not given enough lead in time when approached with a project
by researchers. This can lead to a lack of time to plan and cost the project
properly. It can also result in issues of skill availability.
