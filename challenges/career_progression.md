## Methods of career progression

The method to move between roles and grades varies between institutions.
Some institutions now allow direct progression to higher grades via a promotions process.
Others require people to apply for a vacant role at the higher grade, which may be open to internal applicants only.

However, some institutions are now creating technical leadership roles that allow
staff to progress without moving into a managerial role.
