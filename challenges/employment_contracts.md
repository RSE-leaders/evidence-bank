# Employment Contracts

Differing RSE employment contracts across institutions can make it difficult to
align career path requirement and RSE expectations.

RSEs in academia typically come under two types of employment contract:

- As an academic staff member
- As a professional services staff member

Contracts can also be:

- Permanent
- Fixed term
