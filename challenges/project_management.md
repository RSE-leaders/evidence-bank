# Project Management

## Timesheets

- Timesheets are required by some funders (I.e UKRI).
- Timesheets are required by TRAC methodology.
- Timesheets can be used to compare expected FTE on a project with actual FTE.
- There is an overhead to completing timesheets.
- There can sometimes be a discrepency between actual time spent and the time
  recorded on the timesheet to be submitted to the funder.

### Timesheet tools used by RSE teams

- Clockify
- Toggl
- In house bespoke
- Excel

## Moving to a new project

RSEs that move to a new project often need time to reskill and learn the new domain.
