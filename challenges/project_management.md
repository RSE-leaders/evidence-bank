# Project Management

This challenge refers to the management of RSE projects, including monitoring and
resource allocation.

## Timesheets

- Timesheets are required by some funders (e.g. UKRI, EU).
- Timesheets may be required by TRAC research facilities.
- Timesheets can be used to compare expected FTE on a project with actual FTE.
- There is an overhead to completing timesheets.
- Recording actual time spent can be challenging particularly where time spent
  could be applied to multiple projects or activities

### Timesheet tools used by RSE teams

- Clockify
- Toggl
- In house bespoke
- Excel
- Harvest

## Moving to a new project

RSEs that move to a new project often need time to reskill and learn the new domain.
