## Interview Process

### Technical Interview

Some institutions use a technical challenge as part of the interview process
This is sometimes used to also test soft skills such as "how do you approach a
problem" and "how do you communicate your solution".

## Job description

- We can split job adverts into two sections.
- Expectation of the role. This should be very general to ensure that the RSE
  can adapt to a variety of projects and roles.
- Skills and competencies. This should be more specific and can be tailored to
  the project or team.
