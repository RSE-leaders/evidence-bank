# Funding

Funding RSE can be challenging as we are often split between different forms of funding.

## Glossary

- **Directly Incurred (DI)**: Costs that are directly attributable to a specific
  project or activity.
- **Directly Allocated (DA)**: Costs that are shared across multiple projects or
  activities.
- **Overheads**: Costs that are not directly attributable to a specific project
  or activity.
- **Full Economic Cost (FEC)**: The total cost of a project, including Directly
  Incurred, Directly Allocated, and Overheads.
- **Cost Recovery**: The process of reclaiming costs from a project or activity.

## Funding Models

### TRAC

The Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) is a methodology used by UK higher
education institutions to calculate the Full Economic Cost (FEC) of research
projects. The FEC includes Directly Incurred (DI), Directly Allocated (DA), and
Overheads. Using the TRAC approach means that a day rate is calculated for each
RSE, which is then used to calculate the cost of the RSE's time on a project. This
rate is based on FEC and is used to recover costs from projects.

**NOTE**: Applications for TRAC are currently blocked

Timesheets are required and then billed in arrears.

### Cost Recovery

Some RSE groups are underwritten by the institution and must cost recover from projects.

Cost recovery targets vary between institutions and can be as high as 100%.
On average this target is ??

### DI funded

- When charging as a DI cost, the RSE is directly funded by the project. We have
  to be careful that there is no double counting of costs as funders may have already
  paid for the overheads indirectly.
- Overheads generally passed to funder.

### DA funded

- When charging as a DA cost, the RSE is funded by the institution and the costs
  are shared across multiple projects.
- Overheads generally not passed to funder

### As a post doc

Some RSEs are funded as post docs, and therefore are a DI cost.

## Setting a day rate

Using a day rate for a project is a method of simplifying the funding application
and cost recovery process. The day rate can be calculated using the TRAC methodology(FEC),
or by using a rate based on salary alone.

A day rate can also be useful for grants where it is not necessary to name a specific
RSE.

Some considerations when setting a day rate:

- The day rate may not encorporate salary inflation either due to national inflation
  or changes in spinal point.
- When setting a day rate without a specific RSE in mind you need to consider which
  spinal point to use. If using the spinal point in the middle of the grade this
  may average out but will depend on the RSEs in the group.
- A different rate may be needed for each grade of RSE in the group.
- May need to include percent of senior time in the rate for junior RSEs to cover
  mentoring, training and project management.

## Impact on the researchers

The funding model will impact how researchers are able to access RSEs. We can either
be free at the point of use or we need to cost recover from projects.

## Overheads

There are a number of overheads that need to be considered when funding RSEs. These
include:

- Institution overheads such as estates, facilities, administration, and finance
- Individual admin time
- Time for training and professional development
- Time for funding applications
- Time for none project work such as supporting HPC facilities
- Management time

## Funding Professional Development

Funding professional development has implications on cost recovery.
Funded is needed for the following:

- Training
- Conferences/events
- Membership of professional bodies
- Contribution to community building

## Other challenges

- It can be difficult to trace funding from the funder through the institution and
  back to RSE team.
