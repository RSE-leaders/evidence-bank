Here, and in daughter pages, is the ARC JD framework.

This JD framework defines a generic job description used across all of UCL ARC’s Research Technology Professional Roles. 

Staff are appointed, and roles advertised, with a job title consisting of a seniority prefix and a job family, within this generic JD family.

For staff convenience, individual JDs composed of the appropriate sections from this document may be used as summary
documents for specific staff or recruitments. 

Each such sub-JD will consist of the preamble, text defining the seniorities appropriate to the grade, 
and text defining the expertise associated with a job family and specialisation, taken from this document. 

However, the generic JD framework here is the normative document in force.

For each of the job families, there are a number of possible equivalent titles (separated by a slash “/” below) – staff are able to choose one of these according to preference and roles will be advertised with the option. (To facilitate staff self-identifying in roles that match their career aspirations.)
Seniority Prefixes: Assistant (G6), no-prefix (G7), Senior (G8), Principal (G9) and Professorial (G10)

Job Families:

Research Software Developer/Engineer, 
Research Infrastructure Developer/Engineer, 
Data Scientist / Research Data Scientist / Informatician, 
Data Steward/Data Consultant, 
Research Manager


Roles may also be associated with a domain or technical specialisation, 
which may be indicated in a personal choice of job title, e.g. Senior Research Software Engineer (HPC) or Assistant Bioinformatician.
