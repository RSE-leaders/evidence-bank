# ARC Promotion Scheme

Since 2022 ARC has an annual promotion scheme for permanent staff in the department working within one of our 5 professions.
The scheme aims to make it easier for high-performing staff demonstrating the appropriate skills and behaviours of performing at a higher grade to be recognised, and to accelerate their internal career progression.
There are now two distinct processes for staff being promoted; an annual panel for G6 through to G9 described here,
and a separate process for staff being promoted from G9 to G10 run when needed.

The route for applying is by self-referral, though normally staff will have help and support from their line manager in preparing their submission.
Managers are expected to support their direct reports via regular appraisals, developmental goal setting and one-to-ones.
Promotion applications will be considered by the Promotions Committee, consisting of Leadership Team member(s), Heads of Profession, representatives from UCL Human Resources and UCL’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion teams.
The committee will adhere to [UCL's Recruitment & Selection guidelines](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/recruitment-and-selection-procedure#The%20Recruitment%20Panel) around panel diversity.

The percentage of promotion opportunities per cycle is limited to no more than 10% of the total number of ARC staff.
Outstanding performance within an individual’s job description does not automatically mean that promotion will follow; neither does meeting some of the duties and responsibilities of the target job description.
The ARC Promotions Committee will retain the right to award promotion on the basis of the case in the round.

## Scheme guidance - Grade 6 to Grade 9

Once a member of staff has passed their probation, there are no qualifying time restrictions on applying or reapplying for promotion.
Candidates should, however, give careful consideration to addressing any feedback received if reapplying for promotion following a previous unsuccessful attempt.

Cases for promotion will be assessed against the job description criteria set out within the roles which make up the RTP Career Framework.
An appraisal or an appraisal review must have been completed within the last six months (consideration will be given where this has not been possible).
The case for promotion should be evidence-based - focusing on how an individual is working at a higher grade within their job family/career framework and how they can evidence supporting indicators from [UCL’s Ways of Working](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-advice/ways-working) at the higher grade.
No member of staff will be expected to meet all the criteria in any area of activity as set out in the job description/ways of working framework.
The criteria are representative examples, aimed at setting levels of expectation, but they could never be totally comprehensive across such a large and complex organisation.
Candidates should familiarise themselves with both the job description and UCL’s Ways of Working for the target grade and ensure that they demonstrate activities in their own promotion case that reflect their own experience, providing indicators of success and personal impact relevant to their own discipline, the department and their career.

All applications need to be validated by the individuals line manager to confirm work achievements and level of working claimed by the applicant. 

## Role of ARC Line Managers

1. Aspiration for promotion should be discussed as a matter of course in the annual appraisal/appraisal review, whatever is closest to the promotions round date. Appraisals/appraisal reviews give an opportunity to review an individual’s development, their working patterns against their existing job description and trajectory against the Careers Frameworks and UCL WoW supporting indicators for the target grade and discuss any areas of further development. Constructive feedback and recommendations for development should be an integral part of this process. Consideration should be given to any specific initiatives or areas of work that could be taken on which would best ensure career development over time.
2. All ARC managers must be aware of equality and diversity issues. Promotion is a key mechanism by which staff progress through UCL and outcomes have a significant impact on UCL’s equalities objective to increase diversity at its highest grades. All roles should be allocated openly, fairly and transparently. Consideration should be given to enable all staff (including staff with caring responsibilities, disabled staff and part-time staff) to undertake these roles, so that they are not disadvantaged in developing their careers. It is particularly important that attention is paid to the career progression of female staff, BAME staff or any other groups that are under-represented at senior levels.
3. Line managers should ensure they have undertaken the most recent Equality and Inclusion training to help support their staff in their application.
4. It is recommended that Line Managers ensure that appropriate mentoring opportunities are made available to colleagues in order to help develop their careers. Mentoring opportunities can be discussed at annual appraisals and any opportunities will be communicated within the department to inform all ARC staff.

## Personal circumstances

1. Candidates are encouraged to indicate any specific personal circumstances that may affect their application. A range of personal circumstances can be taken into account, some examples are as follows:
    * absences due to maternity, adoption, parental or carer’s leave;
    * periods of part-time working;
    * breaks in employment due to non-consecutive fixed term contracts;
    * disability, including temporary incapacity that lasts for more than six months;
    * absence due to ill-health or injury;
    * career breaks of more than six consecutive months.
2. Managers should take any personal circumstances into account when making supporting statements for staff.
3. Similarly, applicants should get in touch if they require a reasonable adjustment to the application process itself.
4. If candidates have any personal circumstances these should be detailed with their application. Individual circumstances should be taken into account when career development is discussed to ensure no members of staff are overlooked for development opportunities. It is the responsibility of the Heads of Profession and Line Managers to ensure such matters are proactively addressed within their teams.

## Applications without manager support

1. Every ARC staff member has the right to propose themselves for promotion, directly to the ARC Promotions committee. Their line manager should normally support them in preparing their application materials.
2. However, staff have the right to propose themselves for promotion without going through their Line Manager and the candidate will submit their application directly to the Promotions Committee. The Line Manager will be informed by the Promotions Committee that an application has been made and will be asked to validate the application to confirm work achievements and level of working claimed by the applicant.
3. Where staff are using the self-referral route without support of a manager a mentor can be provided to help discuss their application. The mentor can be suggested by the individual or assigned by the ARC Leadership teams. All mentors will be independent of the existing hierarchy within the individual’s promotion pathway, and will be able to offer independent and confidential advice around submitting a self-referral.

## Application process

In building a case for promotion all relevant sections from the list below should be included and emailed in pdf format to the submission address.

* A short **CV** including Applicant's name, current job title, Manager's name, and history of career to date, including academic track record (where relevant). This should be a maximum of 2 sides of A4.
* **Personal statement**. A summary outlining the case for promotion, making reference to the skills and experience achieved over the last 12 months as per the criteria below (1,500 words max).
    1. Evidence of how the individual meets the duties and responsibilities of the target job description. Evidence of how an individual’s role has changed or expanded and where it can be demonstrated that the individual is carrying out a substantive part of the duties and responsibilities of the higher graded role.
    2. Developmental progression – behavioural (using UCL Ways of Working framework). Evidence of how the individual is demonstrating the specific supporting indicators relating to Personal Excellence, Working Together and Achieving our Mission for the desired promotion grade. Choose 3 examples which do not need to be the same as the target JD. Highlight where they have taken on additional duties or supported departmental or intercollegiate endeavours.
    3. Developmental progression – training/experience. Evidence of any qualifications achieved over the last 12 months, or other relevant experience carried out, that demonstrates capability that the candidate will meet the essential criteria within the personal specification for the desired job description/role.
    4. Achievement of developmental goals. A list of goals and evidence of their achievement should be provided demonstrating working towards the target grade. As per the Eligibility section below, please note that application to the scheme is contingent on the majority of goals being achieved on the previous appraisal/appraisal review (which should have taken place within the last six months, ideally in the appraisal window of Jan - April).
* **Referees Statements** (for G8 promotion to G9). Two statements from UCL staff members or people outside UCL demonstrating where the candidate has made a significant impact in their current role and grade. Referees should be impartial/independent and should not include the Line Manager or any member of the candidate’s immediate team.
* **Line Manager statement**. An assessment of the candidate against the above criteria to support the case for promotion. In the event an application is made without line manager support, this is not required.

## Selection process (via Promotions Committee)

1. Once the application deadline has closed, applications will be validated with the individual's line manager to confirm work achievements and level of working claimed by the applicant.
2. The application will then be passed to the ARC Promotions Committee who will review applications in advance of the Promotions Committee meeting.
3. At the meeting, the Committee will consider each application against the RTP Career Framework and come to a decision. They will review the applications and select the appropriate option for each candidate.
4. If a candidate is performing well but does not sufficiently meet the criteria to warrant promotion to the new job description, the Committee can at their discretion recommend an accelerated increment or award of an additional contribution point.
5. Following the meeting the results will be communicated via the Head of Profession. The Head of Profession should then meet with the individual to feedback the results and inform the line manager of the outcome.

## Panel

We typically have representation from ARC Senior Leadership Team including Head of Professions, ISD affiliated staff, HRBP, Inclusion Lead, Academic and Professional Service staff across UCL departments and beyond, e.g. other ARC like institutions.
As of 2024, the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre will be aligning and running their promotions process alongside ARC and they will have representation on the promotions panel.

## Results

For promoted staff a new contract will be issued. For staff who receive an accelerated increment, an email will be sent confirming that this action has been completed.

It is important that all successful candidates are recognised for their achievements and a list of all promoted staff will be published on an annual basis.

## Eligibility

* All ARC staff members at Grade 6 - 9 (where a promotions pathway has been identified) are eligible to apply for promotion (please see the Restrictions on applying section for exceptions).
* Promotion is available to staff with available promotion pathways wishing to be promoted into roles up to and including Grade 10. For staff where pathways are not available they should follow the usual recruitment procedure when positions become vacant.
* In order to apply for promotion an appraisal or an appraisal review must have been completed within the last six months. (Consideration will be taken into account if this has not been possible.)

### Restrictions on applying

* Promotion is not available to any employee who is still to complete their probationary period.
* Promotion is not available to staff currently on secondment outside of ARC unless the department has agreed to run and align their promotions process. As of 2024, this is the case for the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre.
* Where an employee is subject to a disciplinary sanction, they may be restricted from being promoted. Specifically:
    * If a member of staff is the subject of an investigation, then the promotion is suspended pending a satisfactory outcome of the investigation;
    * If a member of staff is on a performance improvement plan or being managed under the capability procedure, they cannot be considered for promotion that year.
