# Job advert

The UCL Research Software Development Group, founded in 2012, was the first of its kind, and is one of the leading university-based research programming groups in the UK. We are currently a team of 11 RSEs and we are looking for more people to join us!

We work across college developing high-quality software in collaboration with scientists, engineers and scholars from all research domains.

Whether this means using Python to build up a database of ancient Sumerian writings, parallelising Fortran codes for surface catalysis simulations, adding red blood cells to a supercomputing simulation of brain blood-flow, refactoring DNA forensics code in R, or designing and building a big data image processing library in C++11 and Python, we do it all, bringing specialist programming expertise, modern development practices (CI, TDD, Agile…), and engineering rigour to academic software. We provide expert software engineering consulting services to world-leading research teams, and collaborate with scientists and scholars to build software to meet new research challenges.

If the following describes you, then you should consider working with us:

* You have created and maintained software to address research problems in one or more fields.
* You can rapidly assimilate understanding of new scientific questions, and quickly connect research needs to software requirements.
* You are committed to software development best practices, and know how to adapt these to research contexts.
* You are expert in one or more languages and platforms used for scientific computing, and are keen to expand your knowledge.
* Please note that, on this occasion, we are also interested in interviewing candidates with experience of front-end web development, with or without a research background. If you are looking into applying your skills into education and research, we’d love to hear from you.

For more details check out this advert. Applications must be received by 14th October 2018. This position is permanent but subject to the availability of continued funding sourced from appropriate research collaborations, and is funded for two years in the first instance, with salary negotiable up to £46,359. We would also welcome applications from candidates interested in a part-time position.
