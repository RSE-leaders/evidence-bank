# EPCC

* EPCC currently has around 100 staff of which approximately 80 perform RSE-like work.

## Position within University of Edinburgh

EPCC is officially an instute within the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Edinburgh.
This position gives EPCC the same status within the University as an academic school.

## Organisation and Structure

EPCC is split into a number of different groups (although staff can and do span multiple groups
at times depending on their work):

* Applications Group: software projects (majority of RSE work)
* Systems Group: responsible for running and maintaining the systems and services EPCC host as well as infrastructure (cooling, networking, power, etc.)
* Commercial Group: responsible for liaising with commercial contacts and also have a key role in writing large funding applications (e.g. EC funding)
* Administration Group: Financial, HR, administrative support for EPCC

A matrix management system with a project-based approach is used with many staff working on multiple
projects at once. A monthly scheduling meeting is used to assign staff to projects based on skills
and availability.

## Progression and Promotion

All posts (with a tiny number of exceptions) at EPCC are appointed as open-ended postions - generally staff are initially 
employed on 2 year contracts that automatically convert to open-ended contracts at their end. As EPCC pre-dates the
RSE term, the names of the different roles do not currently incorporate the term RSE. Progression for the RSE-type
roles at EPCC follows the following structure:

* [Application Developer (UoE Grade 6)](job-desc/appdev.md)
* [Application Consultant (UoE Grade 7)](job-desc/appcon.md)

After Grade 7 the progression path splits into a technical path and a managerial path. Most staff at Grade 8 and 
beyond are actually neither purely technical nor purely managerial and their official job title usually 
reflects which side they lean more towards.

Technical path:

* [Architect (UoE Grade 8 and above)](job-desc/arch.md)
* [Principle Architect](job-desc/parch.md)

Managerial path:

* [Project Manager (UoE Grade 8)](job-desc/projman.md)
* [Programme Manager (UoE Grade 9)](job-desc/progman.md)

Beyond these posts lie senior managment roles such as Technical Director, Director and these are not generally linked
to a particular grade.

For promotion/regrading, staff also need to consider the University of Edinburgh general grade criteria, see: https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/grade-profiles_updated_august_2018_v.6.pdf
