UCL's Advanced Research Computing Centre (ARC) uses a [generic job description framework](/rse/ucl-arc/) across all its Research Technology Professional roles, at seniority levels from Assistant to Professorial.

The 'Assistant' level is equivalent to Junior levels elsewhere and is suitable for applicants straight from undergraduate degrees.
